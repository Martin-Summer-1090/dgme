\title{Check gains-from-trade condition (heuristic for 2x2 Cobb-Douglas)}
\usage{
.check_gains_from_trade(e, alpha, q)
}
\arguments{
\item{e}{2x2 endowment matrix.}

\item{alpha}{Length-2 vector of Cobb-Douglas exponents.}

\item{q}{Bond price.}
}
\value{
Logical: TRUE if the heuristic passes.
}
\description{
For Cobb-Douglas preferences in a 2-household, 2-good economy, a monetary
equilibrium requires that the gains from trade are large enough to
compensate for the interest-rate friction imposed by the bid-ask spread
\eqn{(1, q)} on money.  This function applies two checks:
}
\details{
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Utility comparison.}  Compute the Walrasian equilibrium
(frictionless, \eqn{q=1}) and compare each household's utility at
the Walrasian allocation to autarky.  The utility gain must exceed
a threshold that scales with the interest rate \eqn{r = (1-q)/q}.
\item \strong{Endowment asymmetry.}  Check that endowments differ
sufficiently across households relative to the interest rate.
}

Both checks are heuristic (sufficient but not necessary).  A \code{TRUE}
return is a good indicator that equilibrium exists; \code{FALSE} is a
warning, not a proof of non-existence.
