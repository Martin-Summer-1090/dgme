\title{Compute optimal consumption for a Cobb-Douglas household under the DG
collapsed budget constraint.}
\usage{
.cobb_douglas_demand(p, eh, alpha_h, mh, q, regime_tol = 0.00000001)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Price vector (length 2), in money units.}

\item{eh}{Endowment vector (length 2).}

\item{alpha_h}{Cobb-Douglas exponent for good 1.}

\item{mh}{Outside-money endowment.}

\item{q}{Bond price (state price \eqn{\pi_1}).}

\item{regime_tol}{Tolerance for regime boundary detection.}
}
\value{
Optimal consumption vector (length 2).
}
\description{
The collapsed NA budget set is kinked: for each sign pattern of the net
trade vector \eqn{\tau^h = x^h - e^h}, the constraint is linear with
different effective prices.  Purchases cost \eqn{p} per unit; sales yield
only \eqn{q \cdot p} per unit (discounted by the state price).
}
\details{
This function evaluates the Cobb-Douglas optimum on each linear face,
checks which regime is consistent with the assumed sign pattern, and
returns the consistent solution.  Near kink boundaries, a fallback picks
the regime with the smallest inconsistency.
