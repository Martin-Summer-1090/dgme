\title{Treasury solver: both goods in category B (fungible payment media)}
\usage{
.solve_treasury_both_B(params, g, G, tol, maxit, ...)
}
\description{
When both goods accept either payment medium, the split between
outside-money and token payments is indeterminate.  Only total
payment capacity matters.  This reduces to the baseline solver
with augmented money endowments m^h_eff = m^h + g^h.
