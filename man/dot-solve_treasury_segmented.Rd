\title{Treasury solver: segmented categories (O/T/B split)}
\usage{
.solve_treasury_segmented(params, g, G, tol, maxit, ...)
}
\description{
When goods are assigned to different categories, the two payment
constraints (T-O) and (T-S) bind separately.  The household must
allocate outside money to category-O and B purchases, and tokens
to category-T and B purchases.
}
\details{
With |L|=2, the interesting case is: good 1 in "O" (outside money
only), good 2 in "T" (tokens only), or one in "O"/"T" and the other
in "B".  We handle the general case.
