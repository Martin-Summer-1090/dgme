Description: Compute and visualise low-dimensional examples (2 households, 2
    goods) of monetary equilibria based on the Dubey-Geanakoplos (1992, 2003,
    2006) model of a monetary economy with outside and inside money. The package
    accompanies the paper "Stablecoins and the Monetary Order: Inflationary
    Finance and Competing Settlement Assets" (Summer, 2026) and implements
    numerical computation of equilibria for four model variants: baseline,
    substitution, Treasury channel, and competing outside money.  Includes
    publication-ready LaTeX tables, TikZ figure generation for budget sets and
    nominal-transfer diagrams, and comparative-statics tools.
